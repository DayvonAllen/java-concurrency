## Thread Safe Collections
- `Blocking Queues`
  - `ArrayBlockingQueue` - bounded, has a maximum
- `Delay Queues` - unbounded, items expire after a delay(it's sorted) and then we can access them
- `PriorityBlockingQueues`
- `ConcurrentMap`
  - `ConcurrentHashMap`
- `CopyOnWriteArrays` - efficient implementation of the synchronized ArrayList.
  - Updates to the list are O(n) because a copy needs to be made.
  - there is no locking when threads are reading
- `Exchanger` - allows two threads to exchange objects
