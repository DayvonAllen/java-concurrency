## Semaphores
- Invented by Dijkstra in 1962
- Semaphores are simple variables(or abstract data types) that are used for controlling access to a common resource
- It is an important concept in Operating Systems as well.
- It is a record of how many units of a particular resource are available.
- Counting Semaphores - allows an arbitrary resource count.
- Binary Semaphores - semaphores that are restricted to the values `0` and `1`
- Tracks only how many resources are free, it does not keep track of which of the resources are free.
- The semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions(web servers)
- Producer-consumer problem can be solved and implemented with the help of semaphores(Dijkstra's approach).
